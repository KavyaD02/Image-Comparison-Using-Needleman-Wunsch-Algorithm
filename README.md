# Image-Comparison-Using-Needleman-Wunsch-Algorithm

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a global sequence alignment algorithm that has traditionally been used for DNA, RNA, and protein sequencing. Image comparison is used in multiple applications like distorted face image recognition and color identification. In this paper, image comparison has been introduced as a new application of the well-known Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. The global sequencing algorithm has been used to align images using pixel values. Two image comparison applications have been demonstrated, illustrating the use of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. First, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm has been used for distorted face recognition. Next, traffic light color identification has been performed using the alignment technique. This work provides an insight into the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and establishes a new application for it.
